                         NewsStats To-Do List
                         ====================

This is a list of planned bug fixes, improvements and enhancements for
NewsStats.

Bug numbers refer to the Mantis issue tracker at <http://bugs.th-h.de/>.

* General
  - Improve Documentation
    The documentation is rather sparse and could use some improvement.
  - Add a test suite
    There is currently no kind of test suite or regression tests. Something like
    that is badly needed.

* Additional features
  - Add hierarchy information (GroupInfo - Bugs #19 #20 #21 #22 #23 #24 #25 #26)
    NewsStats should be able to recognize invalid (i.e. officially not existing)
    newsgroups and - optionally - drop them from the list of groups. On the
    other hand, it should recognize existing, but empty groups and add them with
    a posting count of 0 to its list.
    NewsStats should be able to do that for any past month.
    It would be nice to make up a kind of hierarchy database from that with
    information like description, charter and moderation status. You should be
    able to get a list of valid groups for any given month (with a bit of slack
    for late creation and deletion), optionally including the previously
    mentioned information; and you should be able to get the history of any
    group.
  - Add other reports
    NewsStats should include some other kinds of reports (stats on used clients,
    on postings hosts/servers, ...)
  - Add tools for database management
    NewsStats should offer tools e.g. to inject postings into the 'raw' database,
    or to split databases.

* Individual improvements
  + NewsStats.pm
    - Add error handling when reading config (Bug #13)
      NewsStats should check if all mandatory options are set. Some syntax or
      content related checks would be in order.
      Some other tests - working database connection, valid database and table
      names - would be nice.
